# Active-Directory-Hacking-Project-
This is an Internal penetration testing report on an home lab active directory environment setup. Attack scenarios in this report try to replicate the events from an actual organizational active directory enivironment, attacker/pentester is connet to the local area network and tries to enumerate and exploit the network and systems. 
This descriptive lab report is nothing but a project for my resume and with time I will keep making changes in it.
This report consists of 5 files namely (1) Home Lab Setup Description (2) Network Mapping (3) Intial Attack and Compromise (4) Post Compromise Enumeration (5) Post Compromise Exploitation
